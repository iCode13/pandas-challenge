# Pandas Challenge: Heroes of Pymoli

Obtaining insights into purchasing trends for the game, Heroes of Pymoli, using the Pandas library in Python.

## General Info

This project showcases the analysis of purchasing data from a gaming company for their fantasy game, Heroes of Pymoli. Although the game is free-to-play, optional items are available for purchase to enhance the gaming experience of users. The aim of this project is to analyze the game's purchasing data (including purchase ID, screen names, age, gender, game item ID and name, and price) to understand trends, and obtain meaningful insights for the company.

## Data Trends

The following trends emerge after detailed analysis of this dataset:

* Trend 1 - 
Gender demographic evaluation revealed distinct gender trends. Player gender is dominantly male, about 84%. Only ~14% of total players are female, with the remaining ~2% being classified as other/non-disclosed gender. However, the dominant male demographic also seems to be more price resistant in spite of spending the most overall, and each male player spends only 90% of what the remaining two demographic groups usually spend per person. 

* Trend 2 -
Age demographic show that the age group with the greatest number of players is the 20-24 years age group, representing close to half of the total players in the dataset. Few players (<= 5% of dataset) are noted from <15 years as well as the >35 years age groups. These age trends also show direct correlation to the purchase patterns, with the highest count and value of purchases coming from the 20-24 years age group. 

* Trend 3 -
The popular game items are usually also the most profitable. The top selling item is the Oathbreaker, both in number and total purchase value, and has sold 12 units at a price of $4.23 each.
